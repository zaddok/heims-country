# HEIMS references the ABS for Country list

HEIMS doesnt appear to have a list of country codes, [this page on HEIMS](https://heimshelp.education.gov.au/resources/appendices#AppendixC) references an ABS [excel spreadsheet](http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1269.02016?OpenDocument) which appears to have the correct country code format:

 - ABS spreadsheet: sacc_12690do0001_201903.xls
 - CSV exported from above into australia-un.csv
